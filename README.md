# PyRates
PyRates is a Python Firing Rate Neural Simulation Tool. It is used in the chapter *Integrative Functions of the Corticostriatal System* of the book [*From Neuron to Cognition via Computational Neuroscience*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/neuron-cognition-computational-neuroscience) to simulate a cortico-striatal model of oculomotor learning. The relevant materials for the simulation of the model can be found [here](https://mitpress.ublish.com/book/neuron-cognition#supplements).
